# DISMISSAL ORDER REGARDING SPECIAL GUARDIANSHIP  
## RECORD OF SYSTEMIC FAILURES, MISCONDUCT, AND SAFEGUARDING SCANDAL

### Case Overview

This court records its gravest concerns regarding the handling of the case of Amber May Stuart, born 16 May 2018 in Huyton, Merseyside. The failures and misconduct outlined below constitute a scandal of national and international significance.

#### Key Facts

1. **Unlawful Removal and Abduction Risk:**  
   - In March 2022, Amber May Stuart was unlawfully removed from her mother’s care by family members. Amber has not been seen by her mother since that date.
   - The risk of abduction is high, and the abuse suffered by the child necessitates immediate consideration for refuge for both mother and child.

2. **Grandmother’s Alcohol Abuse and SGO Misconduct:**  
   - The grandmother, Nichola Duffy (married name Stuart), had a history of excessive alcohol consumption before the court granted the Special Guardianship Order (SGO).
   - The Local Authority failed to act on this risk and did not prevent the SGO being made.

3. **Fabrication and Misrepresentation of Orders:**  
   - Evidence exists of a faked and non-existent non-molestation order.
   - The respondents falsely claimed a protection order was already in place. The mother submitted a child occupation and protection order on 4 May 2025. The non-molestation order claimed the mother’s order was dismissed on 5 May 2025, but the mother never submitted an order on that date; her application was on the 4th.
   - The official online court reference system failed to recognize the mother’s reference, and telephone confirmation stated the last hearing was on 14 July, while the mother had a hearing on 26 June 2025. The dismissal of the mother’s orders lacks proper explanation.

4. **Systemic Data and Process Breaches:**  
   - Section 8 (Children Act) has been breached; data protection violations are evident, and sensitive case information has been leaked in chronology statements.
   - Statements from an impersonated social worker will be referred to the Crown Court for criminal investigation.
   - The grandfather and grandmother will both be under investigation for their roles.

5. **Parental Alienation, Abuse, and Neglect:**  
   - The father sent an unsealed, scrunched-up letter to the mother’s home, containing national insurance information and claims that he was forced to give up parental rights by his mother and aunt.
   - Allegations exist that the mother is being wrongly accused and held in contempt, while child abuse and neglect have occurred:
     - The child was denied an inhaler, allowed unsupervised internet access (Snapchat, Roblox), and exposed to continued alcohol use against local authority agreements.

6. **Immediate Child Protection Required:**  
   - The child, Amber May Stuart, must be returned immediately to her mother, Beth Murphy, at 21 Seal Road, Huyton, Liverpool.
   - An application for refuge is made for the mother and child.
