# DISMISSAL ORDER REGARDING SPECIAL GUARDIANSHIP  
## RECORD OF SYSTEMIC FAILURES, MISCONDUCT, AND ONGOING SAFEGUARDING SCANDAL

### Case Overview

This court records its gravest concerns regarding the handling of the case of Amber May Stuart, born 16 May 2018 in Huyton, Merseyside. The failures and misconduct outlined below constitute a scandal of national and international significance.

#### Key Facts

1. **Unlawful Removal:**  
   - In March 2022, Amber May Stuart was unlawfully removed from her mother’s care by family members.  
   - Amber has not been seen by her mother since that date.

2. **False Representation and Misconduct:**  
   - The court was repeatedly misled, including:
      - A family member falsely presented as the assigned social worker.
      - False and misleading information about the status of guardianship and welfare provided to the Family Court.
      - A fake or invalid website and an obsolete email address (jo.prince@liverpool.gov.uk) were supplied for court communication.
      - The real social worker's identity was concealed; “Jo Prince” is not current, and the real name is Nichola Duffy.
   - The grandmother, Nichola Duffy (married name Stuart), removed Amber from her father, Curtis James Stuart, on grounds of neglect after seven years of excessive alcohol intake, prior to any order being made.

3. **Discrimination and Breaches:**  
   - The mother suffered discrimination based on health grounds.
   - There were breaches of data protection legislation.
   - There was a failure to comply with European Union Emergency Protection Order requirements.

4. **Failure to Protect and Act:**  
   - Domestic violence was reported in October 2024 against the child, with no meaningful intervention or investigation by authorities.
   - The grandmother refused to view or acknowledge the valid court order in the mother’s possession.
   - The authorities, including the Local Authority and Cafcass, failed to act on repeated evidence and reports of harm.

5. **Fabrication and Obstruction:**  
   - Authorities allowed fabricated evidence and testimony in family court.
   - The Special Guardianship Order was misrepresented as invalid or “not real” by social services.
   - There was active obstruction of justice and denial of contact between Amber and her mother.

6. **Irregularities in Guardianship:**  
   - Excessive alcohol consumption by the grandmother prior to the order was ignored.
   - Domestic violence was permitted to continue with no intervention.
   - Amber’s legal and human rights have been systematically violated.

### COURT'S FINDINGS

Upon overwhelming evidence of repeated breaches and gross misconduct, the Family Court finds:

- Local and national authorities failed in their statutory safeguarding responsibilities.
- The handling of this case constitutes a scandalous miscarriage of justice and child protection.
